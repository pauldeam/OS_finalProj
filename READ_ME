*** also need to download json-c (use this for download help https://github.com/json-c/json-c) ***

To compile file type: "make run" - The details of this are in MakeFile

*****
If "./main: error while loading shared libraries: libjson-c.so.4: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory" is output you  may need to add a line to this file:

$ cat /etc/ld.so.conf

include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf //already in file
/usr/local/lib		    //need to add this to /etc/ld.so.conf

then update the cache by:
$ sudo ldconfig
******

JSON file is in "output.json"

readFile.c contains the bulk of our code
